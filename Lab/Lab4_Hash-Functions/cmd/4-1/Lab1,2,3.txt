Lab 1: Coding DES, AES using cryptopp library
A. Required:
+) Mode of operations:
  - Select mode from screen (using switch case)
  - Support modes:  ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, XTS, CCM, GCM.
+) Funtions: Key generation, encryption, decryption function:
   Select from screen (using command-line or GUI)
+) Inputs:
  - Secret key,  Initialization Vector IV, and nonce,..
  Select from screen (using command-line or GUI)
  Case 1: Secret key and IV are randomly chosen for each run time
  Case 2: Input Secret Key and IV from file (using file name/)
 - Plaintext
    Case 1: Input from screen;
    Case 2: From files (using file name);
    - Support Vietnamse (using setmode, UTF-8)
 - Ciphertext
    Case 1: Input from screen;
    Case 2: From files (using file name);
    - Support Vietnamese (using setmode, UTF-8)
+) Output (hex/base64 encode, binary):
   - display in screen;
   - write to file;

Report Lab 1
Write your report in word file including:
  1. Report your hardware resources;
  2. Report computation performance on Windows and Linux (in tabe with capture image on running your program);
    - Generate a set of different input sizes (at least 6 inputs in size KBs up to MBs)
    - Execute your code and check the computation time on average 10 000 running times;
    - Summarize the results in a tables including: size of input, OS (Windows, Linux), encryption time and decryption time.
    - Do a comparison and your comments on both input size and OS;

Lab 2: Coding AES using only C++ without other cryptographic external libraries;
Required:
+) Plaintext:
    - Input from screen;
    - Support Vietnamese (using setmode, UTF-8)
+) Mode of operations
     Using CBC mode
+) Secret key and Initialization Vector (IV)
     Input Secret Key and IV from screen
Report Lab 2
Write your report in word file including:
  1. Report your hardware resources;
  2. Report computation performance on Windows and Linux (in tabe with capture image on running your program);
    - Generate a set of different input sizes (at least 6 inputs in size KBs up to MBs)
    - Execute your code and check the computation time on average 10 000 running times;
    - Summarize the results in a tables including: size of input, OS (Windows, Linux), encryption time and decryption time.
    - Do a comparison and your comments on both input size and OS;

Lab 3: RSA-OAEP Cipher using CryptoPP
Required:
+) Funtions:Key generation; Encryption; Decryption function (using command-line or GUI)
1) Key generation
  Public Key, Privae  Key;
  Save to files (DER, PEM);
2) Encryption
+) Plaintext:
    - Support Vietnamese (UTF-8)
    - Input from screen or from file (using command-line or GUI)
+) Secret key/public key
    - The keys load from files (command-line or GUI)
    - The public key: >= 3072 bits
+) Save to file/ print to screen with diferent format (BIN, HEX, BASE64)
3) Decryption
+) Ciphertext:
    - Input from screen or from file (command-line or GUI)
+) Secret key/public key
    - The keys load from files (command-line or GUI)
    - The public key: >= 3072 bits
+) Recover text: Save to file/ print to screen

Report Lab 3
Write your report in word file including:
  1. Report your hardware resources;
  2. Report computation performance on Windows and Linux (in table with capture image on running your program);
    - Generate a set of different input sizes (at least 3 inputs in size KBs up to MBs)
    - Execute your code and check the computation time on average 10 000 running times;
    - Summarize the results in a tables including: size of input, OS (Windows, Linux), encryption time and decryption time.
    - Do a comparison and your comments on both input size and OS;
